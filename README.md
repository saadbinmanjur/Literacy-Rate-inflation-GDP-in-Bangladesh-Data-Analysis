### Insights
#### Literacy Rate vs. GDP Growth
- GDP increased significantly after 2010, corresponding with a slight increase in literacy rates.

#### Inflation Rate Trends
- From 1980 to 2000, inflation showed fluctuations, with peaks and declines. After 2010, inflation remained stable until a rise post-2020.

#### Poverty Rate vs. GDP
- A positive trend was observed where GDP exceeded 400B after 2016, and poverty rates fell to 10%.

#### Urban vs. Rural Population Trends
- A linear increase in urban and rural populations was observed, with rural areas consistently more populated.

#### Trade Balance vs. GDP
- GDP saw a significant rise post-2010, whereas trade balance growth was relatively minimal.

#### CO2 Emissions & Deforestation
- CO2 emissions increased over time due to deforestation, showing a proportional relationship.

#### Suicide Rate Trends
